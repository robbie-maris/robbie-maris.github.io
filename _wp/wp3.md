excerpt: 'Both vaccine information and misinformation is spread through social media, in ways that may vary by platform. We utilise a balanced panel dataset of 257 respondents stated Covid-19 vaccine preferences to test whether social media use is associated with changes in likely vaccine uptake, and whether trust in sources of information has a moderating role. We surveyed New Zealanders online in August 2020, October/November 2020 and March/April 2021, while vaccines were being developed, approved by regulators and initially rolled out. For each survey wave, based on their choices between hypothetical vaccine options, we classify respondents as resistant (never chose a vaccine), hesitant (chose a vaccine between one and five times) and pro-vaccine (chose a vaccine six out of six times). To analyse this novel application of stated choice data, we use a set of Logit models to analyse transitions between categories between waves at the individual level, as well as a pooled partial proportional odds model to analyse the data in panel form. We find a positive or neutral association between social media use and vaccine uptake. In our transition modelling, we see some evidence that Facebook, Twitter and Tiktok users who are pro, are less likely to become hesitant or resistant. Facebook and Instagram users who are hesitant are more likely to become pro. Additionally, some social media platforms may have a more positive effect on vaccine uptake preferences for those who do not trust the government. In interpreting our results, we note an overall high level of pro-vaccine orientation in New Zealand over the time period of the study. The paper contributes to the wider evidence in the literature, which shows social media can be associated with reinforcing both pro- and anti-vaccination sentiment, with the former being the main effect in this particular context and time period.'
